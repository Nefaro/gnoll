Wilderness is an idea, a group of concepts, that would make the game more random, more chaotic, more wild.

The WildernessTrees component changes the growths speed of trees and modifies the value of the tree logs, and hence all wood based crafts.

The growth has the following modifications:
* Trees can grow in the winter
* The general tree growth speed was reduced by 5 times
* However, each tree gets individual growth bonus. A 5 sided die is rolled (8, 5, 5, 1) times, for (Summer, Spring, Fall, Winter), summed and multiplied by 12.5%.
* Additionally each tree has a favorite and disliked season. On favorite season, the growth bonus is multiplied by 3, disliked season by 0.1
* Rain gives a +12.5% additional bonus

This is all calculated in the beginning of a new game and varies between games, giving an unpredictable outcome.

In general, the trees can grow about 80 times slower or about 3 times faster.

For wood value a (5d5-15) is thrown, less than 1 is rounded to 1, giving a range from 1 to 10, with a 66.7% chance of still having a value of 1. 

This gives a bit more reason to experiment with various trees, figuring out, which ones to grow for fast crafting, which ones for high value trading.
Specially so, if the game is modded with additional trees and not all trees spawn at the starting position.
